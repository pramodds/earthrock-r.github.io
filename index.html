            <h2>Coming to the Internet</h2>

            The Internet has always been considered the stepping stone to absolute connection with everyone. With its pros and cons, it can be awarded the Most Controversial Item, surely. The lifeline of the Internet: HTML. Knowing to code through it is basically like getting a pro membership on your web browser. I have never dreamt coding is not just knowing how to code; it is the art of actually telling Google to search for sites which give info on how to code, because if you come upon an issue in any coding language, the issue is something that has to happen to at least a hundred other people, or else it is a weird problem that you have committed but have not noticed. Now, I making a website I had yearned to do, but had told myself: "later". But the later is now, and we cannot procrastinate forever. This is actually a website that has been coded, and published. It has been quite a way to get to the net.
