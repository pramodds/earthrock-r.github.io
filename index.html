            <h2>Global Warming</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="post-content" style="float:none">
           Global Warming can be described as an event or an era in human history. if global warming is an event that is going to happen in the future, we can stop it. We can’t stop it until it happens if we are not the source of it. But if we are the source of it [which is 100% true], we can actually stop it before it begins. In the era perspective, we cannot predict it until it actually happens, but if we are the cause of it then the prediction is possible for those who are not the cause of it, but since we are all the cause of it, 90x9 people who continue to do it and not do anything about them doing it, it is a huge problem in both the perspectives. It is in the event perspective easier to solve this problem than the era perspective, but this event will be a very long event and date is DOOA [dependent on our actions]. The event will lead in a new era, and this event will change history of the Earth as well as humans and nature. Or this era will do all that. 

The cause of global warming is humans. Humans have destroyed the balance of greenhouse gases and oxygen in the atmosphere, so there is actually no ‘most polluted city’. If it were so, than Tokyo would be for its content of atmosphere. Pollution is the main cause of global warming. It is the cause, while deforestation destroys the prevention, therefore increasing space for the cause. Pollution is caused in various ways, but only one is necessary for global warming:

Air pollution- This is caused by aircrafts, industries, cars, trains, coal stations, etc. When these gases get into the atmosphere, they trap heat. Since the heat cannot escape, The oceans and seals consume it and release it at cold regions, thus making it warmer. The Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets melt because of the trapped heat.

Deforestation is the mass destruction of forests. Forests convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. Destruction of trees inadvertently lead into more carbon dioxide, and more pollution. However, trees do not convert gases like methane, etc. into oxygen, so we need to stop emitting these gases or start researching new ways to convert these gases or trap them. 

Global Warming has various ways in which it shows it self. Some of these ways are:

Habitat Loss - Animals in polar regions are using habitat because of melting ice sheets. One such famous example is the polar bear which has to hunt on sea ice instead of thick ice. 
Floods - Cities near the coast will be in danger of being flooded. land seas will be formed. Major urban and rural settlements will be destroyed due to melting polar ice sheets. 

Although such calamities are possible, global warming, whether era or event is preventable if we follow some guidelines:

Optimise petrol usage.
Reduce plastic usage.
Plant trees.

            <h2>Coming to the Internet</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="post-content" style="float:none">
            The Internet has always been considered the stepping stone to absolute connection with everyone. With its pros and cons, it can be awarded the Most Controversial Item, surely. The lifeline of the Internet: HTML. Knowing to code through it is basically like getting a pro membership on your web browser. I have never dreamt coding is not just knowing how to code; it is the art of actually telling Google to search for sites which give info on how to code, because if you come upon an issue in any coding language, the issue is something that has to happen to at least a hundred other people, or else it is a weird problem that you have committed but have not noticed. Now, I making a website I had yearned to do, but had told myself: "later". But the later is now, and we cannot procrastinate forever. This is actually a website that has been coded, and published. It has been quite a way to get to the net.
